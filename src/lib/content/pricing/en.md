## 1. Market Overview 2026: What Does Web Design Cost in Austria?

While prices for professional web design have remained stable into 2026, the technical requirements (Core Web Vitals) and legal compliance (AI Act, Accessibility Acts) have significantly increased the complexity of builds.

### Pricing Matrix by Project Type (Estimated Net Prices)

| Website Type                     | Investment (from) | Project Duration | Recommended For                                      |
| :------------------------------- | :---------------- | :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **High-Conversion Landing Page** | **€ 650,-**       | 1-2 Weeks        | Startups, specific ad campaigns, lead gen            |
| **Business Pro (Corporate)**     | **€ 2,000,-**     | 3-6 Weeks        | SMEs, service providers, local businesses            |
| **E-Commerce / Webshop**         | **€ 3,250,-**     | 4-8 Weeks        | Online retail, D2C brands, manufacturers             |
| **Custom Experience / 3D**       | **€ 5,000,-**     | 2-4 Months       | Brands looking for the "Wow" factor (SvelteKit + 3D) |
| **Custom Web-App / SaaS**        | **On Request**    | 3-9 Months       | Platforms, portals, complex software solutions       |

## 2. Why the Price Range is So Vast (The Value Drivers)

The term "website" covers vastly different technological approaches. In 2026, the gap between "standard" and "high-performance" has widened further.

### A. Strategy & Sales Psychology (The Invisible Value)

A cheap website is often just a digital brochure. A professional website is a **24/7 sales representative**.

- **User Research:** Who is the target audience? (Pain points, motivations)
- **UX Design:** How do we guide the user to the goal without friction?
- **Copywriting:** Content that doesn't just inform but actually converts.

### B. Technology Choice (SvelteKit vs. WordPress)

- **Standard (WordPress/Builders):** Cheaper upfront, but often slow, maintenance-heavy, and more vulnerable to security breaches.
- **Premium (SvelteKit/Headless):** Lightning-fast load times (< 1s), extremely secure, and future-proof. Modern architecture offers massive SEO advantages that lead to lower long-term marketing costs.

### C. Accessibility (Legal Requirement Since 2025)

The **Accessibility Act** has been mandatory for many businesses since mid-2025. Compliance (WCAG 2.1/2.2) requires expert knowledge and increases the initial price, but it protects against legal issues and significantly boosts Google rankings.

## 3. Freelancer vs. Agency: Who is the Right Partner?

Your choice of partner often influences the price more than the feature list itself.

| Criteria                  | Freelancer (Specialist) | Small Agency       | Large Full-Service Agency |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------------ |
| **Hourly Rate**           | € 90 – € 150            | € 120 – € 180      | € 180 – € 300+            |
| **Communication**         | Direct, personal        | Project Manager    | Hierarchical              |
| **Flexibility**           | Very High               | Medium             | Low (rigid processes)     |
| **Typical Project Price** | € 2,000 – € 10,000      | € 5,000 – € 25,000 | € 20,000 – € 100,000+     |

**My Advantage:** As a full-stack developer, I offer agency-level quality without the massive overhead. You pay for results, not for the office rent or the sales team of a large agency.

## 4. Running Costs: The "Website Subscription"

A website, like any piece of infrastructure, has fixed costs. Here is an honest calculation per year:

| Item                      | Costs (approx. / year) | Why it matters                          |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Premium Hosting**       | € 120 – € 300          | Speed & reliability (Servers in AT/EU)  |
| **Domain Fees**           | € 15 – € 50            | Your address (.at, .com, .net)          |
| **Maintenance & Support** | € 400 – € 1,200        | Security updates, backups, small tweaks |
| **SEO & Content**         | Optional               | To stay on top of Google rankings       |

## 5. ROI Calculation: When Does the Website Pay for Itself?

Let's look at an example for a **service provider in Austria**:

- **Website Investment:** € 3,500 (one-time)
- **Running Costs:** € 150 / month
- **Value of a New Customer (LTV):** € 2,500 (profit)

If the new website generates just **2 additional customers per year** due to better positioning and a higher conversion rate:

- **Additional Profit:** € 5,000
- **Costs (Year 1):** € 5,300
- **Result:** The website pays for itself within about 13 months. From year 2 onwards, it generates pure profit.

## 6. SEO Check: How to Recognize Quality

When comparing quotes, look for these technical details. If they are missing, the offer is overpriced—no matter how low the sticker price is.

1.  **Core Web Vitals:** Does the site reach a Google PageSpeed Insight score of 90+?
2.  **Semantic HTML:** Is the code cleanly structured for search engines?
3.  **Mobile-First:** Does the site work as intuitively on an iPhone as it does on a desktop?
4.  **Security:** Is an SSL certificate included, and is the site hardened against attacks?

---

## Conclusion: Buying Cheap Often Costs Double

An € 800 website that brings zero customers is a waste of € 800. A € 3,500 website that automatically feeds your business with qualified leads is the best investment of your fiscal year.
