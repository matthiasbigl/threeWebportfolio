## 1. Market Overview 2026: Orientation Values for Web Design in Austria

While prices for professional web design have remained stable into 2026, the technical requirements (Core Web Vitals) and legal compliance (AI Act, Accessibility Acts) have significantly increased the complexity of builds.

### Orientation Matrix by Project Type (Estimated Net Prices)

| Website Type                     | Orientation Price (from) | Project Duration | Recommended For                                      |
| :------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **High-Conversion Landing Page** | **from ca. € 650,-**     | 1-2 Weeks        | Startups, specific ad campaigns, lead gen            |
| **Business Pro (Corporate)**     | **from ca. € 2,000,-**   | 3-6 Weeks        | SMEs, service providers, local businesses            |
| **E-Commerce / Webshop**         | **from ca. € 3,250,-**   | 4-8 Weeks        | Online retail, D2C brands, manufacturers             |
| **Custom Experience / 3D**       | **from ca. € 5,000,-**   | 2-4 Months       | Brands looking for the "Wow" factor (SvelteKit + 3D) |
| **Custom Web-App / SaaS**        | **Individual**           | 3-9 Months       | Platforms, portals, complex software solutions       |

## 2. What Influences the Price (The Value Drivers)

The term "website" covers vastly different technological approaches. In 2026, the gap between "standard" and "high-performance" has widened further.

### A. Strategy & Sales Psychology (The Invisible Value)

A cheap website is often just a digital brochure. A professional website is a **24/7 sales representative**.

- **User Research:** Who is the target audience? (Pain points, motivations)
- **UX Design:** How do we guide the user to the goal without friction?
- **Copywriting:** Content that doesn't just inform but actually converts.

### B. Technology Choice (SvelteKit vs. WordPress)

- **Standard (WordPress/Builders):** Cheaper upfront, but often slow, maintenance-heavy, and more vulnerable to security breaches.
- **Premium (SvelteKit/Headless):** Lightning-fast load times (< 1s), extremely secure, and future-proof. Modern architecture offers massive SEO advantages that lead to lower long-term marketing costs.

### C. Accessibility (Legal Requirement Since 2025)

The **Accessibility Act** has been mandatory for many businesses since mid-2025. Compliance (WCAG 2.1/2.2) requires expert knowledge and increases the initial price, but it protects against legal issues and significantly boosts Google rankings.

## 3. Freelancer vs. Agency: Who is the Right Partner?

Your choice of partner often influences the price more than the feature list itself.

| Criteria                  | Freelancer (Specialist) | Small Agency       | Large Full-Service Agency |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------------ |
| **Hourly Rate**           | € 90 – € 150            | € 120 – € 180      | € 180 – € 300+            |
| **Communication**         | Direct, personal        | Project Manager    | Hierarchical              |
| **Flexibility**           | Very High               | Medium             | Low (rigid processes)     |
| **Typical Project Price** | € 2,000 – € 10,000      | € 5,000 – € 25,000 | € 20,000 – € 100,000+     |

**My Advantage:** As a full-stack developer, I offer agency-level quality without the massive overhead. You pay for results, not for the office rent or the sales team of a large agency.

## 4. Running Costs: The "Website Subscription"

A website, like any piece of infrastructure, has fixed costs. Here is an honest calculation per year:

| Item                      | Costs (approx. / year) | Why it matters                          |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Premium Hosting**       | € 120 – € 300          | Speed & reliability (Servers in AT/EU)  |
| **Domain Fees**           | € 15 – € 50            | Your address (.at, .com, .net)          |
| **Maintenance & Support** | € 400 – € 1,200        | Security updates, backups, small tweaks |
| **SEO & Content**         | Optional               | To stay on top of Google rankings       |

## 5. ROI Calculation: When Does the Website Pay for Itself?

Let's look at an example for a **service provider in Austria**:

- **Website Investment:** approx. € 3,500 (one-time)
- **Running Costs:** € 150 / month
- **Value of a New Customer (LTV):** € 2,500 (profit)

If the new website generates just **2 additional customers per year** due to better positioning and a higher conversion rate:

- **Additional Profit:** € 5,000
- **Costs (Year 1):** € 5,300
- **Result:** The website pays for itself within about 13 months. From year 2 onwards, it generates pure profit.

## 6. SEO Check: How to Recognize Quality

When comparing quotes, look for these technical details. If they are missing, the offer is overpriced—no matter how low the sticker price is.

1.  **Core Web Vitals:** Does the site reach a Google PageSpeed Insight score of 90+?
2.  **Semantic HTML:** Is the code cleanly structured for search engines?
3.  **Mobile-First:** Does the site work as intuitively on an iPhone as it does on a desktop?
4.  **Security:** Is an SSL certificate included, and is the site hardened against attacks?

## 7. Individual Consultation: The Best Way to Get an Accurate Quote

The best way to find out the exact cost for your project is a personal conversation. During this we clarify:

- Your specific requirements and goals
- The scope of the project
- Desired features and functionality
- Timeline and priorities

**After this conversation, you will receive a tailored quote** – transparent, without hidden fees.

## Conclusion: Buying Cheap Often Costs Double

An € 800 website that brings zero customers is a waste of € 800. A € 3,500 website that automatically feeds your business with qualified leads is the best investment of your fiscal year.
